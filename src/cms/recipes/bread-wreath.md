recipeSections:
  - instructions: >-
      Start by adding your flour, salt and sugar to a food processor or bowl. 
      Pulse or mix. If using processor, cut butter into 1 tablespoon cubes and
      add to your food processor and pulse until sand-like (30 seconds max). If
      not using a food processor, grate your butter using a cheese grater
      directly into the bowl and use your fingers to rub the butter into the
      flour. You want a sandy mixture, with the stray pea-sized piece of butter
      here and there. The crumbs should clump when pressed together.
  - instructions: >-
      Pour crumbs onto a sheet of plastic wrap and pack together using the
      plastic to be a barrier (careful not to over-handle). Make sure your dough
      brick is fully wrapped. Chill for about 30 minutes to an hour in the
      refrigerator.
